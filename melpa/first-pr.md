### Brief summary of what the package does

Loco lets you type any key sequence, including those requiring the modifiers Alt, Control, Hyper, Meta, or Super, without using any physical modifier keys except Shift. This makes it easy to enter key sequences that are complicated or use hard-to-reach keys.

Loco works by translating key sequences from one form to another. It does not redefine the standard key bindings, nor does it prevent you from defining your own. Learn the few rules of Loco and be productive immediately, using the key bindings you already know.
